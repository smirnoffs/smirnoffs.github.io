= Problem with six package on El Capitan

I was trying to install link:http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html[Virtualenv Wrapper] on my new Macbook and pip failed on installing *six*. Turns out that El Capitan has its own *six* installed in system protected folder. 

The solution is next:
```
pip install virtualenvwrapper --ignore-installed six
```
